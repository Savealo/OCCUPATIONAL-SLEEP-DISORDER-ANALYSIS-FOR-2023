# OCCUPATIONAL-SLEEP-DISORDER-ANALYSIS-FOR-2023
This project aims to analyze individuals of different gender and occupation and the extent to which sleep quality, daily exercise, BMI and sleep duration influences blood pressure, heart rate and if or not they have sleep disorder.
INTRODUCTION

Objective of the Project: This project is designed to analyze individuals of different gender and occupation and the extent to which sleep quality, daily exercise, BMI and sleep duration influences blood pressure, heart rate and if or not they have sleep disorder.

Problem Being Addressed: This project will try to analyses and address the factors that may lead to sleep disorder.

Key Datasets and Methodologies: The dataset used is the individual health records. The methodology employed is the use of pivot tables, line charts, bar charts, column charts and pie charts to analyze the data to identify trends and hidden patterns.

STORY OF DATA

Data Source: The data was obtained from Kaggle.com

Data Collection Process: This data was obtained from Kaggle.com

Data Structure: The data contains 376 rows with each representing a distinct individual’s details and 13 columns representing person ID gender, age, occupation, sleep duration, quality of sleep, physical activity level, stress level, BMI category, blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps and sleep disorder.

Important Features and Their Significance:

ü Person ID — this is the ID number assigned to everyone.

ü Gender- this is the gender of the individual.

ü Age- this is the age of the individual.

ü Occupation — this is the type of work the individual does.

ü Sleep duration- this is the average number of hours the individual sleeps daily.

ü Quality of sleep- this is the actual time spent sleeping daily.

ü Physical activity level- this is the measure of the amount of physical activity done.

ü Stress level — this is the measure of the extent to which the individual is stressed on a scale of 1–10

ü BMI category- this classifies the individuals as being normal, overweight or obsessed.

ü Blood pressure- this is the measure of the individuals blood pressure readings.

ü Heart rate- this is the measure of the individuals total heart beats per minute.

ü Daily steps- this is the measure of the total step taken by the individual daily.

ü Sleep disorder- this feature tells us if the individual has any form of sleep disorder or not.

Data Limitations or Biases

There is no data limitations observed.

DATA SPLITTING AND PREPROCESSING

Data Cleaning: The data was cleaned by removing duplicates, identifying and removing blanks, and ensuring that no inconsistencies are observed. Thereafter, the data was converted to a standard excel table to ease analysis.

To remove duplicate, simply copy the entire data (ctrl +shift + end) then navigate to the data tab and on the data tools ribbon to select “remove duplicates”.

To identify and remove blanks, simply copy the entire data (ctrl +shift + end) on the home tab navigate to the editing ribbon and click “Find and select”, then navigate to “Go to Special” and select “Blanks”, finally click on OK.

Handling Missing Values: There were no missing values in the data.

Data Transformations: No data transformations were performed.

Data Splitting: The data was splitted into dependent and independent variables. The dependent variables are sleep disorder, stress level, person ID, sleep duration, Quality of sleep, Physical activity level, Stress level, and Heart Rate.

While the independent variables are Gender , Occupation, BMI category, Age, Blood pressure.

Industry Context: the data is from the healthcare industry.

Stakeholders: HR Team.

Value to the Industry: This analysis will help to identify factors that may lead to sleep disorder and management approach to avoid any form of sleep disorder.

PRE-ANALYSIS

Key trends: Individuals aged between 43 to 44 have the highest rate and tendency to develop of sleep disorder.

Potential Correlations:.

IN-ANALYSIS

Unconfirmed Insights:

1. Individuals aged between 43 to 44 have the highest rate of sleep disorder.

2. Based on occupation, Nurses have the best sleep Quality.

3. Females have better sleep quality than Males.

4. Males have a higher incidence of sleep disorder than Females.

Recommendations:

1. Find out why individuals of this age category have sleep disorder and explore measures to address it.

2. Investigate why other occupations have poor sleep quality.

3. Find out why Females have better sleep quality than Males and explore measures for improvement.

4. Find out why Males have a higher incidence of sleep disorder than Females and explore measures for improvement.

Analysis Techniques Used in Excel:

Pivot Tables were used to analyze the data to generate meaningful visual insights.

Other features used are:

Grouping- this was used to group the ages into a range.

Sorting- this was used to arrange data from the highest to the lowest and vice versa.

POST-ANALYSIS AND INSIGHTS

Key Findings:

1. Age 43 to 44 have the highest rate of sleep disorder

2. By occupation, Nurses have the best sleep quality while Managers have the least sleep quality

3. Females have better sleep quality than Males and Males have a higher incidence of sleep disorder than Females

Comparison with Initial Findings:
RECOMMENDATIONS AND OBSERVATIONS

1. Age 43 to 44 have the highest rate of sleep disorder

2. By occupation, Nurses have the best sleep quality while Managers have the least sleep quality

3. Females have better sleep quality than Males and Males have a higher incidence of sleep disorder than Females.

Optimizations or Business Decisions:

Sleep sensitization

Perform a general sensitization program to enlighten individuals on the need and importance of adequate sleep.

encouraging health promotion measures and relaxation strategies to help manage stress.

Introducing and maximizing Shifts

shift work should be introduced to ensure employees are accorded the adequate resting time.

Recommend that Nurses be encouraged to keep it up while other professions be encouraged to improve their sleep quality as it will lead to improved productivity.

Males should be encouraged to improve their sleep quality as it can help prevent sleep disorder and lead to improved productivity.

Unexpected Outcomes:

None.

CONCLUSION

Key Learnings:

1. Sleep quality plays a role in the tendency of an individual developing sleep disorder. The better the sleep quality the less likely such an individual develops sleep disorder.

2. Considering that females have a better sleep quality than males, it is expected that males will have a higher incidence of sleep disorder.

Limitations:

The data does not put into account external factors such as working conditions, period of data collection i.e. the data may have been collected during nurses off duty hours or days etc.

Future Research

Additional research can be conducted to analyze how stress level may affect sleep quality and sleep disorder.
